openborne - Open-source Bloodborne OpenGL reimplementation

openborne is a Bloodborne reimplementation written in C++ and OpenGL. This
reimplementation does not include the game files, as that is strictly against
the game publishers policy and against the law. Simply put,
openborne is an engine, the game files are entirely separate.

openborne targets most mainstream operating systems such as Windows,
Linux and Mac OS X.

openborne has online support, but it does not connect to the main
servers, but an emulated server which is hosted on a remote RamNode server.
You may find the server emulator here: https://github.com/Openborne/bloodnet

To install, you will need:
	- SDL1.2
	- zlib
	- OpenGL 2.x+
Then, just type in:

make
make install

and you should now have openborne compiled and installed.
